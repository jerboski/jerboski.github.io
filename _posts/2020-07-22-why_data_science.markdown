I don’t recall the first moment I chose to pursue a path in Data Science or even when it first piqued my interest but if I had to guess it would be the first time, I began coding for a work project and saw the benefits of automation as well as the power of coding. I was never a big computer guy but I always enjoyed numbers and mathematics, primarily for the certainty of an answer, unlike writing (small humor) so I probably describe my path to data science to be somewhat organic. 

The first part of this path revolves around a love for numbers and now I am discovering statistics. My degree and career path started in Finance, which is a heavy analytical, number crunching field that I am hoping naturally blends into data science. I can see some similarities between the two right off the start. Both require a certain appreciation for math as well as making some sort of conclusion of the data being analyzed.  I am positive there are many more correlations between the two fields that I am hoping will be helpful to me in this bootcamp and ultimately in data science. 

The second part would be a coworker and a fellow friend who went through a bootcamp and are both working in the data science/software development fields. I have had numerous conversations with both around the fields and both of them seemed to be very happy in their current work and couldn’t recommend the field any higher. They love the challenges of the job and the work they produce. Both of them warned me that the bootcamps are fast paced and involve a ton of information but if you are diligent and work hard that you can leave with a great skillset and opportunity which I am looking forward to. 

Obviously, this is a short, summarized viewpoint on why I chose the field, when in reality there is much more than that but knowing that I have homework to finish and sections to get through I am going to end this first blog short with my final thought being I am super excited to start this journey with the self-realization that there are going to be times I will doubt myself or my skills and get frustrated but as the great Lamar Jackson said,” Nobody cares, WORK HARDER.”! I know people care but I love that mindset and will continue to work and push through during those tough times. 

I can’t wait to experience this camp with my cohort and learn from each other. I can tell we have a supportive group eager to help each other and encourage one another to get through. April will be here before we know it so let’s enjoy the ride!
